# docreader

`docreader` is a Python-based command-line interface tool designed to extract and navigate documentation from ReadTheDocs.io. By taking user-inputted URLs of documentation pages and specific questions, it intelligently extracts relevant sections from the documentation to provide users with direct answers or insights about particular functionalities or features.

## Features

- **Dedicated ReadTheDocs.io Focus**: Tailored specifically to extract and interpret documentation from ReadTheDocs.io.
- **Command-Line Driven**: Provides users with a seamless CLI experience to retrieve information swiftly.
- **User-assisted Contextualization**: Accepts user-provided URLs and questions about a tool or feature to find the most relevant documentation sections.

## Installation

Ensure you have the required Python environment and dependencies:

```bash
pip install docreader
```

## Usage

Interact with `docreader` using the command line. Provide the tool with the URL of a ReadTheDocs.io documentation page and your specific question about the tool or feature you're trying to understand:

```bash
docreader --url "https://example.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" --question "How do I configure the API?"
```

`docreader` will then extract and present relevant sections or answers from the documentation based on your query.
